        HTML is not for styling,
        use it for defining the structure.
        Use the proper element for what you mean,
        so that search engines or browsers can render 
        your content correctly. 
    -->

    <!--The em element represents stress emphasis of its contents.-->
    <p>I love learning <em>HTML</em>!</p>
    <!--The strong element represents strong importance, seriousness, or urgency for its contents.-->
    <p>I love learning <strong>HTML</strong>!</p>

    <!--
        Alternatively, we could use <i></i> instead of <em></em>,
        but in that case we couldn't stress emphasis of its content.
        
        or

        We could use <b></b> instead of <strong></strong>,
        but in that case the content inside of it wouldn't be important.
        
        So, we use HTML for defining the content and CSS for styling/designing.

    <!--
        Heading 1 - represents the most important heading
        Heading 6 - represents the least important heading
        We shouldn't use these heading for font-size, instead,
        we should use these headings to create a HIERARCHY.
